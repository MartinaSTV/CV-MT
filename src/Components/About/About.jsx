                <p className='about__text'>I am currently a student at Jensen YH education in 
                GÃ¶teborg. During my education we have worked with java script, html 5, CSS, 
                React etcetera. 
                I am new to the industry but I would like to learn more and develop in this 
                occupation. I got into programming by chance really but it has grown on 
                me and I think it's so fun. I see a future in programming and look forward to learning more 
                and develop in this profession.
