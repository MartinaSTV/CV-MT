                <p className='about__text'>I am currently a student at Jensen YH education in GÃ¶teborg. During my education we have worked with java script, html 5, CSS, react etcetera. I see a future in programming and look forward to learning more and develop in this profession. I work alongside school as an Osteopath and think it's a fun and rewarding job but programming has grown on me and taken a bigger place in my life lately. Who knew programing was so much fun</p>
